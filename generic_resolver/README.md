## Getting Started

*  [odgsg_graphql_utils.py](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/OBG-gen/generic_resolver/odgsg_graphql_utils.py) defines helper functions used to generating the generic resolver function;    
*  [mapping_utils.py](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/OBG-gen/generic_resolver/mapping_utils.py) defines the helper functions used to read parsed RML mappings;
*  [filter_utils.py](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/OBG-gen/generic_resolver/filter_utils.py) defines the helper functions used parse filtering conditions;
*  [filter_ast.py](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/OBG-gen/generic_resolver/filter_ast.py) is used to define the abstract syntax tree to represent filtering conditions entailed with a GraphQL query.
